If you bought one of these maps we will send you an invoice of $11 for this printing increase.  We are in the process of correcting all of our listings....Thanks.\r\n\r\n*** We now offer the 40x60 maps as 36x60 (3x5ft) maps on a synthetic matte banner canvas which is much more durable than paper maps.  There is no added cost for you for this option.  The benefits are that the map is less prone to getting bent\/creased during shipping and they hold up much better .  Also the maps can be framed just like paper maps and look great in a frame.  This is for USA customers only at this time due to shipping costs.\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************\r\n\r\n\r\n  We offer many types of unique and custom maps.

We&#39;re very excited to prepare it for you.\r\n\r\nIf you like, you can have a look at the most common questions about the \r\n\r\nHow long it takes to make the prints?\r\n------------------------\r\nIf the product is already available in the shop, we strive to print it in 2 business days after payment goes through. Since we\u2019re a small operation, it may happen that we lack some printing\/shipping material. We\u2019ll get in touch with you if it delays your order substantially.\r\n\r\n\r\nI need the print before a specific date. Is this doable?\r\n------------------------\r\nMost of the time, yes! Get in touch with us as soon as possible and tell us your needs. We can expedite the process, upgrade the shipping (at a fee), send digital files, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrint packaging\r\n------------------------\r\nTo give the maximum protection to your print, we use two packaging techniques.\r\n\r\nSmall prints: foam board, plastic bag and envelope.\r\nFor letter-sized print (8.5x11 inch) and lower, we ship them in a clear plastic bag reinforced with a foam core backing board. We then place it in a 9x12 envelope.\r\n\r\nLarger prints: tubes\r\nPrints larger than letter are carefully rolled, protected in a long clear plastic bag and then put into a craft tube. Paper stuffing is added at both ends to prevent corner bending.\r\n\r\n\r\nShipping method and delays\r\n------------------------\r\nSmall prints: Canada Post regular letter mail\r\nSmall prints are sent with the same service as letter mail (postcard, invoices, etc.). This method is fast most of the time and doesn\u2019t come with tracking. USA and Canada can expect 4 to 10 business days delivery and other countries from 6 to 20 business days.\r\n\r\nPrints up to 20x28: Canada Post Small Packet \u2013 Air\r\nPrints larger than letter and up to 20x28 inches are sent via Small Packet \u2013 Air service. This method doesn\u2019t come with tracking. USA and Canada can expect 4 to 10 business days delivery and other countries from 6 to 20 business days.\r\n\r\nPrints larger than 20x28: case by case basis\r\nFor larger print, the shipping method will depend on the print size and destination country.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpgrade to express\/tracked\r\n------------------------\r\nAt any time prior to the shipment, you can ask us about an upgrade to a faster \/ tracked shipping option. We\u2019ll give you the price of the upgrade and arrange a transaction. The feature of the upgrade depends on the countries and the print size.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy print didn\u2019t arrive. What should I do?\r\n------------------------\r\nGet in touch with us. We want your full satisfaction and we\u2019ll make sure you\u2019ll receive the print in good condition.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll send you another print if you haven\u2019t received yours after 20 business days (Canada and USA) and 35 business days (International) \u2013 at zero cost for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nI received the print in bad shape. What should I do?\r\n------------------------\r\nWe make our best to protect the prints, but sometime shipping can damage them. In that case, send us a message with a photo of the damaged print and we\u2019ll send you a brand new one \u2013 at zero cost for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe print is fine but I don\u2019t like it.

If you would like to preview the invitations in person, order a sample invitation set from our shop. These samples can be customized with your own wording & colors.\r\n \r\n2. Once you have received your sample and have decided to order, send us a convo with quantities, any color changes, complete wording & details, and info on any extra printed pieces you will need for your wedding.\r\n\r\n3. We will provide you with a custom quote for all of the items you have requested. Once approved, we will set up a reserved listing for you in our shop. \r\n \r\n3. After we receive your payment, we will start work on your personalized proofs. We will send you a convo with your digital proof(s) and make any necessary changes. If you need a hard copy proof, please let us know! \r\n \r\n4. Once you are satisfied with the digital proof and you have double-checked for any spelling errors, etc... contact us to let us know you are ready to have your designs printed. We&#39;ll get started right away and will be sure to keep you updated on the progress of your order. \r\n \r\n5. When we have completed your order, you will receive a final convo from us letting you know that your custom order has been shipped and when you should expect to receive it.\r\n\r\n6. Enjoy your custom designs! Please leave us some feedback and let us know how we did!  We&#39;ll be happy to leave you feedback as well. \r\n\r\nDO YOU CREATE ANY OTHER ITEMS - MENUS \/ PROGRAMS \/ SEATING & TABLE CARDS? \r\nIf you can dream it up, we can do it!  We have designed custom table cards, seating cards, menus, reception cards, programs, accommodation & direction cards ... even water bottle labels and gift tags.  If you want it, send us a convo and we&#39;ll find a way to help you get it!\r\n\r\nCAN I ORDER A PERSONALIZED HIGH-RESOLUTION DIGITAL FILE OF ONE OF YOUR DESIGNS AND PRINT THEM MYSELF?\r\nAt this time we do not sell digital files of our wedding invitation suites. You can contact us about the availability of our other designs. We try to maintain very affordable prices - you will likely find that letting us handle the printing for you will actually save you time and money and free you up to focus on all of the other details surrounding your wedding day or event!\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHT  \r\nAll designs contained within this shop are the intellectual property of Sherie & Cheryl LaPrade and Merrymint Designs.

Each design is based on an actual map and then recolored with digital watercolors. Once painted the maps are then &quot;oversketched&quot; by hand to bring out the various details of the terrain and cities. The finished result is a totally unique and different map that is ready to hang in your home or office.\r\n\r\n-We can do a custom map of ANY LOCATION in the world. The detail can be street level to the entire city. You choose the area and we will do the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                                            -Watermarks are not on your finished prints!!\r\n\r\n-Our prints are printed by a Professional Printing Company...

The company we use to print our images is located in Rhode Island, and once your order is placed with us, the printing process starts there. On average, your print will arrive in 5-7 days after the order is placed in the US. \r\n\r\nRather than personally printing our products, we decided to use a professional printing company to increase your options, ensure consistent results, and offer the highest quality prints....at a fantastic price.\r\n\r\nAll custom orders will require extra processing time, and we&#39;ll communicate those details when we confirm your order.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nPurchases made within the US will ship via USPS First-Class Mail. Orders will be shipped to the address listed with PayPal unless you designate otherwise.\r\n\r\nInternational orders may receive a US Customs Number.\r\n\r\n*** Please note that once an order leaves the US it can no longer be tracked.\r\n\r\n*** International orders can take anywhere from 2-6 weeks to arrive, and possibly longer, depending on your location and if they get held up in Customs.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYour order is sent out with the utmost care in a poster tube. If your order is lost or bent\/damaged by the Post Office, please contact us so we can follow up with the printing company to get a replacement\u2013at no charge to you\u2013as soon as possible.
